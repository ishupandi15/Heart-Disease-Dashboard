## 🧭 Project Overview
This project analyzes **heart disease risk factors** using the **UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset**.  
It was completed in **three phases** — Planning, Decision Making, and Dashboard Implementation — culminating in an **interactive Tableau dashboard**.  

The project aims to:
- Explore relationships between cardiovascular attributes (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)
- Identify significant risk factors for heart disease
- Provide interactive, visual insights for healthcare professionals, analysts, and policy makers

## 🧩 Project Phases

### **Phase I – Planning**
- Dataset selected: **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**
- 303 rows × 14 attributes (age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.)
- Identified data types, domains, and potential dashboard users
- Listed 15+ exploratory questions

📄 [View Report – Phase 1](reports/Phase1_Planning.docx)

---

### **Phase II – Decision Making**
- Chose **Tableau Desktop** for dashboard creation and **Tableau Prep Builder** for preprocessing
- Cleaned missing values (`thal`, `ca`), fixed data types, and simplified target variable
- Designed 10 visualizations and 4 interactive controls (heart disease status, gender, age group, fasting blood sugar)
